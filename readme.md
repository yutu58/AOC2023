# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions by yutu58

This is a repository with my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event, implemented in Java.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: This directory contains all the Java source files for the solutions, organized by day.
  - `dayN/`: Each day's solutions are stored in their respective directory (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.), with separate files for each part of the challenge.
- `inputs/`: Contains input files for each day's challenge. These are named corresponding to the day of the challenge (e.g., `input1.txt` for Day 1).

## How to Use

To run any of the solutions, you need to compile and execute the Java file corresponding to the day and part you're interested in. For example, to run the solution for Day 1, Part 1:

```bash
javac src/day1/Day1a.java
java src.day1.Day1a
```
Replace day1 and Day1a with the appropriate day and part for other solutions.
